# Fundamentals of Web Applications

## Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

**Frontend** is the part of a web application that _users directly interact with_. It focuses on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience, while acting as a bridge between the user and the backend system.

### User Interface: 
- The frontend is responsible for the visual appearance of the application, while ensuring that the design is responsive and user-friendly.
- It includes elements such as buttons, forms, text, images, videos, etc.

### User Interaction
- Handles user actions like clicking, typing, scrolling, submissions, etc.
- Updates the UI dynamically without reloading the page in modern applications.

### Communication with Backend
- Frontend communicates with the Backend through **APIs** (usually via HTTP/HTTPS requests).
- It sends user data to backend for processing, receives responses and displays them appropriately on the UI. 

## Q2. Role of Backend (BE)
**Backend** is a part of a web application that _runs on server_ and handles business logic, data, and security. 

## Server-side processing
- It processes requests received from the frontend, and generates responses that  are sent back to the client.
- It handles business logic such as calculations, validations, and workflows.
- It also handles communication between frontend and database.

## Database Handling
- It stores, retrieves, updates, and deletes data from databases.

## Security and Authentication
- Manages user authentication and controls authorization.
- It protects data from unauthorized access and attacks.

# Q3. Business Logic
**Business Logic** refers to the set of rules and decisions that define how a business operates within a web application. In essence, the business logic determines what the application actually does when a specific action occurs.

# Q4. Client-Server Model
The **Client-Server Model** is the fundamental architecture where tasks are divided between two parties: one that asks for a service ( the **Client**) and one that provides it (the **Server**).

**Client** is the user-facing part usually a web browser or mobile app. It sends requests and displays responses.

### Server
- The server processes client requests.
- It contains business logic, databases, and security mechanisms.

Client -> Request -> Server
Client <- Response <- Server

# Q5. Three-Tier Architecture
It divides a web application into three separate layers for better structure and scalability.
 - Presentation Layer
 - Application Layer
 - Data Layer

 # Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language
 JavaScript is widely used as a backend language due to the creation of Node.js. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on servers.

**Performance**: Uses an event-driven, non-blocking model. 
- It handles multiple requests efficiently.

**Ecosystem**: 
- It has a large ecosystem with npm packages. 
- Allows developers to use the same language for frontend and backend.

### Popular Backend Frameworks
- Node.js: JS runtime for backend development.
- Express.js: Lightweight and fast web framework.
- Next.js: Full-Stack Framework for large applications.
